### Here i tried to design this page with the main colors of logo  Kalbonyan Elmarsos which contain green and blue colors ,so all of backgrounds i made are from these two color and also the gradient.

### I saw a lot of pages which contain the same colors and then i draw sections of the page in paper and after that i coded it.

### After that i use illustrator to design the homepage image and tasks image  

### Actually it was a great task for me and it was a challenge for me to make this page because i don't have any ideas about its sections and how can i divide its section 

### This is not the main website for Kalbonyan Elmarsos ,but this is just a design i thought about and i code it with React .
